### 🌟 Current Science Project: **PalaeoMapEurope**
**PalaeoMapEurope** is a Python-based project that visualizes vegetation zones, human artifacts, and their associated radiocarbon ages in Europe during the Quaternary period. This project integrates data from archaeological research to provide:

- 🌍 Interactive geospatial maps using Folium, allowing dynamic exploration of human-environment interactions.
- 🎨 Visualization of radiocarbon-dated human artifacts, showcasing temporal patterns through a gradient legend.
- 🗺️ Integration of vegetation zones and spatial features using GeoJSON data to contextualize human activities within their environmental settings.
- 💡 Insights into human-environment dynamics during key climatic events, including the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

This tool is ideal for researchers studying the interplay between climate, vegetation, and human behavior during the Quaternary period, offering a detailed, interactive approach to exploring the archaeological and environmental record.
